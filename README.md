# Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my **Portfolio Projects** repository.

This directory contains a curated selection of software engineering projects intended for **recruiters, hiring managers, and technical reviewers**. Each project highlights my ability to design, build, and document real, functional software using industry-standard practices. Feel free to view the other directories that have language specific works

## Purpose

This portfolio is designed to demonstrate:
- Practical problem-solving through working applications
- Strong foundations in software engineering principles
- Clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Thoughtful project documentation and presentation

Only projects that clearly represent my technical abilities and growth are included.

## What You’ll Find Here

Each project in this repository:
- Solves a clearly defined problem
- Is implemented with clarity and structure
- Includes a dedicated README explaining functionality, design choices, and usage
- Reflects real development practices rather than purely theoretical work

Projects range from academic foundations to more applied, real-world implementations.
